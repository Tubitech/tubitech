      <h5 style="font-weight: bold; color: black !important;"> 1) FRCGPT</h5>
      <p style="text-align: justify; color: black !important;">
        Every year, the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) introduces a new game based on a specific theme and publishes a comprehensive English rulebook detailing the game’s rules and regulations. However, the extensive nature of this document and its exclusive availability in English can create challenges for teams, particularly those whose primary language is not English. This can make it difficult for teams to quickly access and understand crucial information, potentially impacting their efficiency in preparing for the competition.
To address this challenge, we developed FRCGPT—an AI-powered assistant designed to provide teams with fast, accurate, and Turkish-translated access to competition rules. Participants can directly consult FRCGPT whenever they have questions about game rules, receiving instant responses without the need to navigate through lengthy rulebooks. Instead of spending hours searching for specific rules and regulations, teams can now retrieve the information they need effortlessly, allowing them to manage their processes more efficiently.
This innovation significantly enhances accessibility for all Turkish teams competing in FRC. By offering the rules in Turkish, FRCGPT not only accelerates access to information but also helps teams make more informed and strategic decisions based on a clear understanding of the rules.
With this project, we are revolutionizing the way teams prepare for FRC. By streamlining the rule-learning process, FRCGPT enables teams to focus more on the core aspects of the competition, such as engineering design, problem-solving, and strategy development. Our goal is to eliminate language barriers, improve the competition experience, and empower teams to perform at their highest potential.
