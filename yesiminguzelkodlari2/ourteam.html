  <h2 class="display-6 text-center text-danger mb-4" style="color: #630101 !important; font-family: 'College';">Our Team TUBITECH</h2>

  <p style="text-align: justify; color: #000 !important;">
    Founded in May 2023, our FRC team “TUBITECH” consists of 36 students and  mentors for the 2024-2025 season. Our team members are carefully selected individuals with exceptional talents and entrepreneurial spirit. During the 2023-2024 season, we won the Marmara Regional Finals, securing the “Winner” award, which earned us the opportunity to represent our country, school, and sponsors in the United States. To ensure smooth operations and maximize efficiency throughout the season, our team is divided into three main departments:
    Hardware (subdivided into Mechanics, CAD Design, and Electronics),
    Software,
    Public Relations (PR).
    Each department plays a crucial role in the development and success of our team. Our structured approach ensures that every member contributes meaningfully while gaining hands-on experience in their respective fields.
    At TUBITECH 9694, our mission is to ignite a modern industrial revolution in our country by fostering a community driven by science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM). We aim to inform and inspire the public about STEAM activities, bridging the gap between education and industry. Through peer learning-based robotics programs, we promote productivity and innovation in the community. By collaborating with STEAM-centered students, mentors, and professionals, we emphasize teamwork and values that extend beyond competition. Our focus is on developing communication skills, strategic and competitive robot design, and enhancing our team's reputation while strengthening our engineering leadership
    At TUBITECH 9694, we believe in a future where science, technology, and analytical thinking drive societal progress. Our vision is to expand the influence of STEAM in rural and developing communities, ensuring that every child has access to quality education and opportunities in robotics. We strive to be a guiding force in the FIRST community, aiming to establish multiple FIRST teams and at least one FRC team in every city. By taking these steps, we believe we can foster a new generation of innovators and changemakers.
    At the beginning of each year, we recruit freshman members to ensure the continuity of our team. These new members are not immediately registered in the FIRST system; instead, they assist existing team members, learn essential skills, and gradually integrate into the team. Students who demonstrate exceptional growth and commitment are officially recruited before the Kickoff event. This system not only strengthens our team but also ensures a seamless transition for future generations of TUBITECH members.
    While building competitive robots is at the core of our activities, we firmly believe that FRC is much more than a competition. It is a platform for innovation, leadership, and community impact. Through our outreach initiatives, we aim to inspire young minds and make STEAM education accessible to all. By sharing our knowledge, experiences, and resources, we work towards expanding the FIRST community and fostering a culture of collaboration and learning.
    At TUBITECH 9694, we are more than just a robotics team, we are a movement committed to making a lasting impact. We believe that by working together, we can drive real change and shape the future of STEAM in our country and beyond.
